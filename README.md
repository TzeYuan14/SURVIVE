# SURVIVE: Text based RPG-Survival Game


SURVIVE is a game in which the player must survive in different situations using any means necessary using available options we have provided, the game will choose 
randomly the starting situations and the player will play the game until it is over or finished. The game endings will depend on the player choices, and each choice
has its own merit/demerit that will lead to different designated endings.

When the player clicks the "PLAY GAME" button, the program will start the game by randomly choosing one of the stories including:
1. **Desert**
2. **Dungeon**
3. **Forest  (Recommended:+1:)**
4. **Apocalypse**

In this game, **JavaFX** will be used as our main coding language to develop the GUI, Story, and overall system of the game to be as interesting & efficient as possible.

## NOTE
- You can use any JAVA Complier IDE to run the application.
- If you don't want the stories to be randomly selected, you can change the number of variable **random_init** as shown below in the file **'Start_Screen.java'**.
For instance, if you want to play the Forest story, you can change the **random_init** to 3 so that the program will always execute the Forest story when the player clicks the "PLAY GAME" button.
